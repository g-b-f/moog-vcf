A Kosmo version of the [Kassutronics transistor ladder filter](https://kassu2000.blogspot.com/2018/07/transistor-ladder-filter.html).

You need to match the transistors, which is a bit boring. Those that I got where
already pretty close (within the recommended 2mV limit), but some outliers, so
maaaybe you could just try without matching.

# How to make the PCBs

Go download the latest gerber files [here](https://github.com/sebastianbeyer/KOSMO_ladderfilter/releases/latest).
Then send them to your favorite PCB Manufacturer (I use jlcpcb). Make sure you
check "Specify a location" at "Remove Order Number" for the panel.
